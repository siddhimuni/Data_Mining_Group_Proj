# 🚔 SF Crime Analysis Project

**Predicting Crime Patterns in San Francisco & Optimizing Public Safety Resource Allocation**  
Uncovering hidden patterns in crime data to help cities deploy resources effectively and improve public safety. Using 500,000+ historical crime records, we aim to turn reactive policing into proactive, data-driven strategies.
